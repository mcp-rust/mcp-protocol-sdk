- **Added comprehensive error handling** with proper `McpResult` and `McpError` usage
- **Enhanced VS Code extension integration** with complete TypeScript examples
- **Added real-world development tools** (complexity analysis, TODO finder, project structure analysis)
- **Improved configuration management** with proper JSON schemas
- **Added testing patterns** with unit tests and integration examples
- **Enhanced troubleshooting section** with debug logging

### 2. **Other Clients Integration (other-clients.md)** - âœ… **COMPLETELY UPDATED**

- Connection management with reconnection logic
- Performance optimizations (caching, batching, pooling)
- Security considerations and best practices
- Monitoring and metrics collection

### âœ… **Developer Experience**
- Complete working examples that can be copy-pasted
- Step-by-step integration instructions
- Troubleshooting guides with common issues
- Testing patterns for validation
- Configuration management examples

### âœ… **Consistency**
- Matches the quality and depth of Claude Desktop integration guide
- Consistent code style and documentation patterns
- Proper cross-references between guides
- Unified version numbering (0.5.0) across all examples

## Status Update

**BEFORE**: Only Claude Desktop integration guide was production-ready
**NOW**: **ALL THREE integration guides** are production-ready and consistent

1. **Claude Desktop Integration** âœ… (was already excellent)
2. **Cursor IDE Integration** âœ… (now updated to match quality)
3. **Other Clients Integration** âœ… (now comprehensive and production-ready)

All integration guides now serve as **gold standard references** for MCP integration across any platform or client type. ðŸŽ‰
