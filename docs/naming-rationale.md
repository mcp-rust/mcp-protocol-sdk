# Naming Rationale: mcp-protocol-sdk

## üìã The Question

A community member raised an excellent point about our naming choice:

> "Just a quick and slightly pedantic observe but I would argue that naming it mcp-protocol is verbose. Essentially says model context protocol protocol sdk"

This is a fair observation that deserves a thoughtful response!

## üéØ Our Naming Decision

We chose **`mcp-protocol-sdk`** deliberately, and here's why:

### 1. **Ecosystem Differentiation** üåê

The Rust MCP ecosystem has multiple implementations:
- `rmcp` (official)
- `mcp-sdk-rs` (community)
- `rust-mcp-sdk` (community) 
- `mcpr` (community)
- `mcp-protocol-sdk` (this project)

Adding "protocol" helps distinguish our SDK as:
- **Protocol-focused**: Emphasizing our 100% schema compliance
- **Standards-compliant**: Our commitment to the official MCP specification
- **Different approach**: From the official `rmcp` (which avoids the redundancy)

### 2. **Clear Intent** üéØ

```rust
// When you see this in Cargo.toml:
[dependencies]
mcp-protocol-sdk = "0.5.0"

// It's immediately clear you're getting:
// - MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality
// - Protocol implementation (not just utilities)
// - SDK (complete development kit)
```

### 3. **Search & Discovery** üîç

Our naming helps with:
- **Crate discovery**: `cargo search mcp protocol` finds us
- **Documentation**: Clear categorization in docs.rs
- **GitHub search**: Distinct from other MCP implementations

### 4. **Precedent in Rust Ecosystem** üìö

Similar patterns exist in Rust:
- `http-client` (not just `http`)
- `websocket-protocol` (WebSocket protocol implementation)
- `json-rpc-core` (JSON-RPC protocol core)
- `grpc-protocol` (gRPC protocol implementation)

The Rust ecosystem often uses descriptive names for clarity.

## ü§î The Redundancy Question

Yes, technically "MCP Protocol SDK" expands to "Model Context Protocol Protocol Software Development Kit" - which does contain redundancy.

However:

### **In Practice, MCP is an Acronym**

Most users think:
- `mcp-protocol-sdk` = "MCP Protocol SDK"
- Not: "Model Context Protocol Protocol SDK"

Just like:
- `http-client` = "HTTP Client" (not "HyperText Transfer Protocol Client")
- `sql-parser` = "SQL Parser" (not "Structured Query Language Parser")
- `json-api` = "JSON API" (not "JavaScript Object Notation API")

### **Clarity Over Pedantry**

```toml
# Clear intent:
mcp-protocol-sdk = "0.5.0"  # ‚úÖ I know what this does

# vs potentially confusing:
mcp-sdk = "0.5.0"          # ‚ùì Which MCP SDK? Official? Community?
mcp = "0.5.0"              # ‚ùì Just the protocol? Client? Server?
```

## üîÑ Alternative Names Considered

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| `mcp-sdk` | Shorter | Conflicts with existing crates |
| `mcp-rust` | Language-specific | Less descriptive |
| `mcp` | Minimal | Too generic, conflicts |
| `rust-mcp` | Clear language | Less searchable |
| **`mcp-protocol-sdk`** | **Distinctive, descriptive** | **Technically redundant** |

## üéØ Our Philosophy

**Clarity > Brevity > Pedantic Correctness**

We prioritize:
1. **User Understanding**: Developers immediately know what this crate does
2. **Ecosystem Clarity**: Distinguished from other MCP implementations
3. **Searchability**: Easy to find when looking for MCP protocol tools
4. **Future-proofing**: Room for related crates (`mcp-protocol-tools`, etc.)

## üèÜ Real-World Usage

In practice, developers use abbreviations:

```rust
// Nobody types the full expansion:
use mcp_protocol_sdk::prelude::*;  // "MCP Protocol SDK"

// Not:
use model_context_protocol_protocol_software_development_kit::prelude::*;
```

## ü§ù Community Feedback

We appreciate the pedantic observation! It shows attention to detail.

However, we believe the practical benefits of our naming choice outweigh the technical redundancy:

- ‚úÖ **Discoverable**: Easy to find in crate registries
- ‚úÖ **Descriptive**: Clear purpose and scope
- ‚úÖ **Distinctive**: Different from official `rmcp`
- ‚úÖ **Consistent**: Matches our GitHub org and documentation

## üìù Final Thoughts

Language evolves, and acronyms become words:
- We say "ATM machine" (Automated Teller Machine machine)
- We say "PIN number" (Personal Identification Number number)
- We say "HTTP protocol" (HyperText Transfer Protocol protocol)

In the Rust MCP ecosystem, `mcp-protocol-sdk` serves its purpose: **helping developers quickly identify and adopt a comprehensive, standards-compliant MCP implementation.**
